============================================
## 1. OVERVIEW
============================================

Emotion recognition is an exciting domain in AI and computer vision. This project enables:
- Real-time detection of facial emotions like happy, sad, angry, and more.
- Integration with live video feed to draw emotion-based annotations.

============================================
## 2. FEATURES
============================================

- Real-time Emotion Detection: Detects emotions directly from your webcam feed.
- Face Detection: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
- User-Friendly Notebook Interface: Designed to simplify execution.
- Customizable Model: Expandable to include additional emotion analysis.

============================================
